              <p class="lead">
                  <p>If you’re looking for an activity that will help you get some physical activity and have fun, water sports may be the way to go. You’ll find a variety of water sports to try, but what should you know before trying one of them?</p>
                  <p>
                      <h1><small>Always put safety first</small></h1>
                      <p>Safety should always be a key priority. But with water sports, safety is even more important — rip currents, physical exhaustion, and other factors significantly increase the risk of drowning. This is why water sport participants are encouraged to always wear a life jacket. While some people may consider themselves strong swimmers who don’t need a life jacket, a floatation device might just be the difference between life and death. So even if the sport doesn’t really require a life jacket, it’s always a good idea to wear one.</p>
                      <p>Additionally, water sport participants should practice basic sun safety, too. Sunscreen is a must-have, especially when you’re outside all day. Even if it’s cloudy, getting sunburn is always possible. In fact, it may be a good idea to wear sun-protective clothing that’s made for water activities. This is even true for activities where you may be partially covered, such as when you try Parasailing Palm Beach. While parasailing can be a fun and relaxing activity with some amazing views, sunscreen is still important.</p>
                      <p>Furthermore, it’s important to stay hydrated. When you’re in the sun and being physically active for long periods of time, dehydration is a big risk. With that in mind, drink plenty of water and avoid alcohol or sugary drinks. </p>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      <h1><small>Respect physical limitations</small></h1>
                      <p>Water sports can be physically demanding and challenging. Activities like water skiing, paddle boarding and even pro surfing lessons require immense strength and concentration for success. So while you may want to jump right into a water sport, it’s important to understand and respect physical limitations.</p>
                      <p>Not everyone is going to have the strength to be successful at water sports right away. This is why you should build up strength before trying a water sport. While there are sports that anyone can do, including tubing, others require quite a bit of physical strength.</p>
