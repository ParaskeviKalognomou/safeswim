      The most significant reasons...</h4>

      <br><br><div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col">
           <h6>1. It helps us breathe</h6>
           <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
            <p class="card-title">Phytoplankton – tiny plant-like organisms that live in the sea – are responsible for at least <a href="https://visibleearth.nasa.gov/images/87465/oxygen-factories-in-the-southern-ocean" target="blank">50% of the oxygen on Earth.</a> <br><br>

            Just like land-based plants, they contain chlorophyll to capture sunlight and use photosynthesis to convert it into the energy they need, producing oxygen as a byproduct. They also consume carbon dioxide, transferring about <a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Phytoplankton" target="blank">10 gigatonnes of carbon from the atmosphere deep into the ocean </a> each year.</p>
          </div>
           <p>

          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <h6>2. It helps regulate the climate</h6>
            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
              <p class="card-title">The ocean absorbs huge amounts of heat from the sun. <a href="https://www.climate.gov/news-features/understanding-climate/climate-change-ocean-heat-content" target="blank"> “More than 90% of the warming that has happened on Earth over the past 50 years has occurred in the ocean,”</a> according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.<br><br>

              That heat tends to be at its most intense nearer the equator, with the water nearest the surface warming the most. Sea currents then transport that heat around the world; north and south, towards the poles. As some of the sea water evaporates it becomes denser and heavier, due to its relatively higher salt content. That causes it to sink, taking some of the warm water deeper.</p>

          <div class="col">
            <h6>3. It’s an important source of food</h6>
            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
              <p class="card-title">Fish is on the menu for billions of people around the world every day. <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/maritimeaffairs/sites/maritimeaffairs/files/docs/publications/blue-growth_en.pdf" target="blank">It accounts for almost 16% of all animal protein consumed globally.</a> Of course, there’s more to seafood than fish, crustacea and other edible creatures. A range of algae and sea plants are also commonly used in cooking.<br><br>

              The UN Food and Agriculture Organization lists sodium, calcium, magnesium, and iodine among some of the important nutrients in seaweed. Iodine deficiency has been identified as the “most prevalent and easily preventable” cause of impaired cognitive development in children.<br><br>

            <h6>4. Its biodiversity is incredible</h6>
            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
              <p class="card-title">It’s not just a source of food. The ocean is also home to an abundance of life. While estimates on the number of species that live in the sea exist, no one knows with absolute certainty what that number is.<br><br>


              According to the US National Library of Medicine’s National Institutes of Health, “91% of species in the ocean still await description.” That’s due in no small part to the vastness of the oceans, which cover around 70% of the planet’s surface and are up to 11,000 metres deep. The number of yet-to-be-discovered creatures living in the sea could easily run into the millions.</p></p>

          <div class="col">
            <h6>5. It creates millions of jobs</h6>
            <div class="alert alert-secondary" role="alert">
              <p class="card-title">By 2030, ocean-based industries will employ more than 40 million people worldwide, an OECD report estimates. The biggest share of those jobs is likely to be in the fisheries sector, followed by tourism.<br><br>

              The economic health of maritime industries is fundamentally linked to the overall health of the oceans, of course. The ocean economy is of particular importance in developing countries, which are home to most of the 3 billion people who rely on the sea for their livelihoods.<br><br>
