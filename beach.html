            <p class="lead">
                <p>
                  <p> First of all, we must find out the importance of rescuing our coasts. For many reasons, one of the biggest dilemmas that we face today is the pollution of our oceans and our beaches.</p>
                  <p>We’ll tell you the reasons that stand out:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>A polluted beach affects the economy</strong>. A beach in poor condition, in addition to everything else, precludes or limits its recreational, lucrative and aesthetic use. Goodbye to the beach pictures, goodbye traveling, goodbye beach volleyball!</li>
                    <li><strong>A dirty beach harms the animals that live on or pass by the beach</strong>. Have you seen videos or photos of turtles with straws on their noses, seagulls with lids on their bellies, crabs and fish that have been damaged by aluminum? Everything is due to the pollution of the coastal areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pollution degrades the habitat of millions of marine creatures</strong>. One of the most devastating examples that afflicts our planet is the whitening that the reefs are suffering, which are home to many species of fish and other organisms.</li>
                    <li><strong>Plastic is already present in all levels of the food chain</strong>. Millions of plastic microparticles and other garbage are ingested by fish and other animals that end up injured, then these animals end up on our plate, and the plastic reaches our body. In a study conducted by Orb Media, of 159 samples taken from different seas around the world, 80% had plastic fibers. There is even evidence that fish have developed an “addiction” to plastic, or that they prefer it for its smell.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="container">
            <h1 class="display-4">What can we do to save our beaches?</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                <p>
                  <p> Good news, we can do something about it!</p>
                  <p>After informing you of the importance of saving the beaches, the next step is to take responsibility for our part as human beings. Today,there are approximately 7.6 billion people on Earth, and we are all connected in one way or another to the ocean, even if we live miles away from the nearest beach, but how can we help?
​
                    It’s important to take action when it comes to our natural surroundings. The time is now, and you’ll see that anything from the simplest move to a drastic change will transform your life and how you view the world. Here are some examples:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Join <a href="volunteer.html">volunteers</a> </strong>. Associations like the Sandos Foundation and socially responsible companies such as Sandos Hotels & Resorts carry out voluntary beach clean-up activities on a regular basis (in our case, once a month) where you can participate. You can even organize your own eco group!</li>
                    <li><strong>Join campaigns</strong>. Movements like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/5minutebeachcleanup/">#5MinuteBeachCleanup</a> create awareness and chains of positive change around the world to keep our beaches free of plastics and other pollutants. Every time you visit the beach, you take five minutes to collect the trashthat you find in your path. It’s a simple way to create a positive impact.</li>
                    <li><strong>Involve your children / nephews / nieces / grandchildren.</strong>. This is one of the most impactful steps we can take, fostering environmental awareness in children and young people, who are often much more open and aware of the world around us and the importance of its conservation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clean up after your pet</strong>. If you go to a beach that allows pets, it’s important to make sure they don’t meet the “call of nature” on the beach and contaminate with their waste.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not take sand, shells or snails</strong>. Look at them, but do not take them home! The shells, snails and sand are the basis for life on the beach. This seemingly innocent practice is largely responsible for the erosion of the beaches of the world.</li>
                    <li><strong>Get rid of as much plastic as you can</strong>. By this, we mean that it’s important to reuse the plastic you already have, but above all, that you do not consume more plastic. You can stop using straws, buy in bulk, choose locally produced foods, etc.</li>
                    <li><strong>Do not use the beach as an ashtray</strong>. Although they seem innocent, cigarettebutts are made with hydrocarbons and cellulose acetate (petroleum derivatives).Once they come into contact with the moisture in the sand, they release toxic substances such as nicotine, tar, lead, arsenic and cyanide, contaminants that can kill the animals that ingest them</li>
                  </ul>
